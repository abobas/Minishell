# Minishell

## Project

This is a project for Codam (42 Network). <br>

The assignment consisted of writing a shell with basic functionality in C. <br>
The shell has builtins like pwd, cd, echo, exit, export, unset, env. <br>
It supports redirections and pipes. <br>
It expands and updates the environment variables. <br>
Non-builtin commands (executables) are searched for within the binary folders specified by the environment and executed in a new concurrent process. <br>
